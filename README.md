Scrapes data from the Pro Football Reference site
This is designed to scrape data from pro-football-reference.com. As is it will get data from 2015-2019. Can be modified to go back as far as you want. You must run get_game_url.py and get_team_url.py first. Then you can run the remainder of the code to get the stats for games, teams, and individual players. Code is built with a sleep timer after each request to prevent ip from getting blocked by the site. Getting player data will take ~32 hours. Games data will take ~12 hours. This saves all tables on each page as .csvâ€™s in their designated folder. The file names are labeled numerically and not by stat type. This is due to the limitations of scraping the site. I will not be uploading the code to clean and sort the data. Most files can be sorted and labeled with simple pattern matching.
