# NFL-Scraper
This is designed to scrape data from pro-football-reference.com. As is it will get data from 2015-2019. Can be modified to go back as far as you want. You must run get_game_url.py and get_team_url.py first. These will gather the corresponding URL’s for every game in the date range as well as the URL’s for team stats for each season and every player who played in those seasons. Then you can run the remainder of the code to get the stats for games, teams, and individual players. Code is built with a sleep timer after each request to be considerate of their bandwidth and prevent ip from getting blocked by the site. Getting player data will take ~32 hours if going from 2015-2019. Games data will take ~12 hours and team data should take ~2 hours. This saves all tables on each page as .csv’s in their designated folder. The file names are labeled numerically and not by stat type. This is due to the limitations of scraping the site. I will not be uploading the code to clean and sort the data. However, most files can be sorted and labeled with simple pattern matching.

Edit: I've uploaded a sample of how to clean the data under clean_team_data.py. It's a deprecated practice file so use as is is not recommended. Simply use it as a guide.
